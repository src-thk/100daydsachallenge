## Overview
This repository contains Data Structure & Algorithm solutions from Leetcode & HackerRank. There can be two or more questions uploaded each day (could be none as well). Some explaination are provided in comments. 

## Nomenclature
Files can start from D, A, L & H. To make this easier to search. For ex: If there is a solution from HackerRank you're looking solution for, you search as `H_Solve-Me-First`. H for HackerRank followed by the underscore and title of the program. Spaces should be converted to hyphens '-'.
H => Hackerrank.
L => Leetcode.
D =>Data Structure.
A => Algorithm.
